    question: "Are you interested in working in Japan?",
    image: "/interview-quiz-images/q1.jpg",
    choices: [
      {
        text: "Yes, I'm very interested",
        score: 1.0,
        emoji: "‚≠ï",
        explanation: "A strong interest in working in Japan is the most important factor. Interest in Japanese language and culture will give you the motivation to learn Japanese and culture, and will give you the strength to overcome even difficult situations. Japanese companies place great importance not only on skills and experience, but also on the desire to work in this country.\n\nEveryone has different reasons for being interested. Want to learn Japanese technology, live a stable life, support your family, advance your career, etc. Whatever the reason, that enthusiasm leads to a sense of seriousness towards the job. During the interview, you will be evaluated even more if you can explain the specific reasons.\n\nInterest in working in Japan also influences long-term retention rates. Those who are interested can continue to think, ``I want to do my best in Japan,'' even if there are difficulties. On the other hand, people who have little interest in studying abroad may immediately consider returning to their home country at the slightest difficulty. The answer to this question is a big deciding factor in hiring, as companies are looking for people who will stay with them for a long time.\n\nThose who answer this will make the most favorable impression during the interview and have a very high chance of being hired. This will be highly evaluated as proof that you are seriously considering working in Japan."

        score: 0.7,
        emoji: "üü°",
        explanation: "The expression \"so-so\" in Japanese is sometimes taken to mean \"not that strong.\" Even if you are actually interested, you may have just answered humbly, but the interviewer feels a little uneasy, wondering if this person's motivation is genuine.\n\nIf you choose this answer, be sure to provide additional explanation during the interview. You can improve your evaluation by conveying specific details of your interest, such as ``I'm interested in „Äá„Äá in Japan'' or ``I'd like to learn ‚ñ≥‚ñ≥ in Japan.''\n\nJapanese corporate culture favors clear statements of intent over understatement. Especially in an interview, it is important to clearly express your feelings. You'll leave a better impression if you answer with confidence, \"I'm very interested.\"\n\nHowever, this answer will not result in rejection. Show your enthusiasm in the other questions and you will be evaluated overall. The important thing is to convey your desire to work in Japan in some way."

        text: "I'm a little interested",
        score: 0.5,
        emoji: "üü°",
        explanation: "The word \"a little\" indicates a low level of interest. The interviewer worries, ``Does this person really want to work in Japan?'' ``Wouldn't he quit right away if he had a better option?''\n\nThere are various reasons for giving this answer. You don't know much about Japan yet, you're considering other countries, your family is against it, etc. However, in interviews, you should avoid negative expressions such as \"a little.\" If you are really unsure, it is better to sort out your feelings first and then apply.\n\nHowever, if you honestly answer \"a little,\" the interviewer may be able to explain in more detail. You may deepen your interest through dialogue, such as ``What are you worried about?'' and ``Is there anything you would like to know about life in Japan?''\n\nIf you have given this answer, be sure to give yourself a chance to make up for it during the interview. You can improve your evaluation by saying something like, ``I was a little nervous at first, but after hearing about your company, I really wanted to work for your company.''"

        text: "I'm not very interested",
        score: 0.0,
        emoji: "‚ùå",
        explanation: "This answer is fatal in an interview. The interviewer cannot understand why a person who is not interested in working in Japan came for an interview. Even if your reason is ``because my family told me to do so'' or ``because I have no other choice,'' if you are honest about it, the chances of you being hired are almost zero.\n\nCompanies avoid the risk of hiring unmotivated people. There is data that shows that people who are not interested are slow to learn a job, quit quickly, and are more likely to get into trouble. Especially when hiring foreigners, the burden on the company is large, such as visa procedures and daily life support, so they only want to hire people who are sure to work for them for a long time.\n\nIf you are not really interested in Japan, there is no need to force yourself to apply. I would be happier if I looked for another job in another country. On the other hand, if you are interested but have a lot of anxiety, be honest about it during the interview. A good company will provide you with information that will ease your concerns.\n\nThis answer is extremely difficult to recover from, no matter how good your other abilities are. During the interview, be sure to choose positive answers."

    question: "Are you studying Japanese?",
    image: "/interview-quiz-images/q2.jpg",
    choices: [
      {
        text: "Yes, I study every day",
        score: 1.0,
        emoji: "‚≠ï",
        explanation: "Your attitude of studying Japanese every day is highly praised. This not only proves your language ability, but also proves that you are a person who can make an effort and can continue to work towards your goals. This serious attitude is what Japanese companies value most.\n\nThere are various ways to study Japanese. Going to school, taking online classes, learning with apps, practicing speaking with Japanese people, watching Japanese dramas, etc. During the interview, you will make a better impression if you can explain your specific study methods. \"I study for 30 minutes every day using an app,\" \"I go to Japanese language classes twice a week,\" etc.\n\nAlso, be honest about your current Japanese level. \"I can read Hiragana and Katakana,\" \"I can have a simple conversation,\" \"I have JLPT N4,\" etc. Even if it's not perfect, it's important to keep learning.\n\nPeople who answered this question are expected to continue learning new things even after joining the company. You can trust that we will actively learn not only Japanese but also work skills."

        text: "I'm studying a little",
        score: 0.7,
        emoji: "üü°",
        explanation: "An answer such as \"I'm studying a little\" isn't bad, but it's hard to convey your enthusiasm compared to \"every day.\" The interviewer may wonder, \"How serious is this person?\"\n\nIf you choose to answer this, please be specific about what you mean by \"a little.\" The interviewer will feel at ease if you tell them specific times and frequency, such as ``I study for an hour twice a week,'' or ``I'm busy with work, but I study on the weekends.''\n\nIt is also effective to talk about your future study plans. If you show a positive attitude, such as ``I'm studying a little bit now, but I'll study more seriously once I pass'' or ``I'm planning to study intensively before joining the company,'' you can improve your evaluation.\n\nIt is important to continue studying Japanese even after joining the company. It is difficult to learn while working, but the better you improve your Japanese, the wider the range of work you can do and the higher your salary will be. Increase your study time little by little, from \"a little\" to \"every day.\""

        text: "I'm going to study",
        score: 0.5,
        emoji: "üü°",
        explanation: "The answer, \"I'm going to study now,\" is honest, but it gives the impression that you are unprepared. The interviewer worries, \"Is this person really ready to work in Japan?\" In particular, not having started studying at the time of the interview may be interpreted as a lack of planning.\n\nHowever, this answer is not completely negative. If you emphasize that ``I haven't started yet, but I'm motivated,'' you have a chance to recover. During the interview, be sure to explain your specific plans, such as when you will start studying, how you will study, and what level you are aiming for.\n\nIt is also important to be honest about the reason you are not studying. ``I recently decided to work in Japan,'' ``I was so busy with work that I didn't have time,'' etc. If you then show that you are determined to study seriously from now on, the interviewer may understand.\n\nIdeally, we recommend that you start studying Japanese at least a little bit before your interview. If you have a track record of studying for one or two weeks, you can answer, \"I'm studying.\""

        text: "not studying",
        score: 0.3,
        emoji: "üü¢",
        explanation: "It takes courage to honestly answer, \"I'm not studying.\" However, it will be a big negative point in the interview. Learning Japanese is essential to working in Japan, and not studying it will be interpreted as being ``unprepared'' or ``unmotivated.''\n\nIf you choose this answer, be sure to explain your reasons and future plans. The interviewer will be understanding if you have a valid reason, such as ``I didn't have the opportunity to learn Japanese in my home country'' or ``I couldn't go to school for financial reasons.''\n\nThen, talk specifically about how you will study after joining the company. You can convey your motivation by setting clear goals, such as ``I will seriously participate in the company's Japanese language training,'' ``I will study by myself for 2 hours every day,'' and ``I will pass JLPT N5 in 3 months.''\n\nThere are jobs where you can get hired even if you have zero Japanese. In particular, there are job openings that do not require the Japanese language, especially for simple work in factories or workplaces where there are many foreigners. However, you should understand that your options will be narrower and your salary will be lower than those who can speak Japanese."

    question: "Can you follow Japanese culture and rules?",
    image: "/interview-quiz-images/q3.jpg",
    choices: [
      {
        text: "Yes, I will respect and protect you.",
        score: 1.0,
        emoji: "‚≠ï",
        explanation: "An attitude of respecting Japanese culture and rules is one of the most important factors when hiring foreigners. No matter how capable a person is, those who do not respect the culture will cause problems in the workplace and deteriorate relationships with those around them. On the other hand, people who respect culture will receive help from those around them even if their language is a little inconvenient.\n\nJapanese culture and rules may differ from those in your home country in many ways, such as being punctual, respecting hierarchical relationships, maintaining cleanliness, and being considerate of your surroundings. However, rather than criticizing things that are \"different\" as \"wrong,\" it is important to accept them as \"something to be learned.\"\n\nDuring the interview, it would be a good idea to talk about what specific rules you know. ``I heard that it's important to be punctual,'' ``I value greetings,'' and ``I respect the separation of garbage.'' If you show that you have researched Japanese culture in advance, your preparation will be evaluated.\n\nPeople who answer this question will be highly regarded as people who can quickly adapt to the workplace and build good relationships with Japanese colleagues. An attitude of respecting culture is the foundation for working in Japan for a long time."

        text: "Yes, I will try",
        score: 0.7,
        emoji: "üü°",
        explanation: "The answer \"I will make an effort\" is positive, but it sounds a little less confident than \"I will respect and protect you.\" The interviewer may feel a little worried, wondering, \"Can this person really protect themselves?\"\n\nIf you choose this answer, be honest and explain why the effort is necessary. If you show a humble and positive attitude, such as, ``I may be confused at first because the culture is different from my home country, but I will study hard,'' or ``If I don't understand something, I will ask questions right away,'' your evaluation will improve.\n\nJapanese culture and rules may seem difficult at first. However, many foreigners get used to it after 2-3 months. What is important is the \"will to protect\". Even if you're not perfect, if you show that you're making an effort, your Japanese colleagues will help you.\n\nIn addition, the word ``try hard'' is also used in Japan to mean ``try hard.'' How the interviewer perceives you depends on your facial expressions and attitude. If you say ``I'll try my best'' with confidence and a serious face, you'll make a good impression."

        text: "it may be a little difficult",
        score: 0.5,
        emoji: "üü°",
        explanation: "Answering ``It might be difficult'' may be honest, but it is a big negative in an interview. Companies cannot hire people who cannot abide by the culture and rules. This is because it may cause trouble.\n\nIf you have given this answer, be sure to specifically explain what is difficult and discuss how to overcome it. ``In my home country, I'm very loose about time, but in Japan I carry two watches so I'm never late.'' ``I've heard that the hierarchy is strict, but I understand that it's important to respect your seniors.''\n\nThe points that are particularly difficult in Japanese culture differ from person to person. Punctuality, use of honorific language, true intentions and tatemae, hierarchical relationships, etc. Thinking about what might be difficult in advance and preparing countermeasures will help you give a convincing explanation during the interview.\n\nHowever, if you say ``difficult'' too much, it will be judged that ``this person cannot adapt.'' While acknowledging that it will be difficult, it is important to show a strong will, saying, ``But, I will absolutely protect it.''"

        text: "I want to value the ways of my home country.",
        score: 0.0,
        emoji: "‚ùå",
        explanation: "This answer is the one you should most avoid in an interview. It's great to respect your home country's culture, but if you want to work in Japan, you need to follow Japanese rules. Saying that you give priority to ``the ways of your home country'' is the same as declaring that ``you will not abide by Japan's rules.''\n\nJapanese companies respect diversity, but expect everyone to follow basic rules (punctuality, safety rules, hygiene management, etc.). If the ‚Äúhome country way‚Äù conflicts with these rules, companies cannot hire you.\n\nIf you really want to preserve your home country's culture, practice it outside of work (in your private life, on holidays, and when interacting with friends from your home country). It's important to strike a balance between following Japanese rules while working and enjoying your home country's culture after work.\n\nIf you give this answer, it will be very difficult to recover. If you really think so, you may want to reconsider working in Japan. On the other hand, if you just said something wrong, correct it immediately. If you rephrase it by saying, ``I value my home country's culture, but I will always abide by Japan's rules,'' there is still a slight possibility."

    question: "If I have a problem, can I talk to someone?",
    image: "/interview-quiz-images/q4.jpg",
    choices: [
      {
        text: "Yes, I will talk to you right away",
        score: 1.0,
        emoji: "‚≠ï",
        explanation: "People you can turn to right away when you have a problem are the most trusted people in the workplace. By seeking help early rather than keeping your problems to yourself, you can prevent small problems from turning into big problems. In Japanese workplaces, the basic rule is to \"report, communicate, and consult (horenso),\" and this attitude is highly praised.\n\nForeign workers in particular often have more trouble than Japanese workers due to language and cultural differences. Not being able to understand instructions at work, having problems in daily life, feeling unwell, having trouble with relationships, etc. If you endure these things alone, you will be stressed out, and in the worst case scenario, you will suddenly quit your job.\n\nThere's no shame in asking for advice. Rather, they are evaluated as ``this person has good problem-solving skills'' and ``this person is good at communicating.'' Japanese companies often have systems in place to support foreign workers and are looking forward to hearing from you.\n\nPeople who answer this question are highly likely to be hired as people who can appropriately handle difficult situations and work stably for a long time."

      {
        text: "Yes, I will discuss",
        score: 0.7,
        emoji: "üü°",
        explanation: "An answer such as \"I will consult with you\" is not bad, but the lack of the word \"immediately\" gives the impression of being a bit passive. The interviewer may be a little worried, thinking, ``Will this person leave the problem alone?''\n\nIf you choose this answer, be sure to explain specifically when you would like to consult with someone during the interview. If you give specific examples such as ``I'll talk to you if I don't understand something,'' ``I'll talk to you if I'm not feeling well,'' or ``I'll talk to you if I have a problem,'' your evaluation will improve.\n\nIt is also a good idea to think about who to consult. Direct superiors, human resources personnel, seniors, colleagues, foreign support desk, etc. The contact information varies depending on the company, so it is important to check before joining the company.\n\nIn the Japanese workplace, the timing of consultation is also important. Ideally, you should seek advice as soon as a problem arises, but you should also consider things like avoiding times when your boss is busy, and starting with the most urgent matters first. The more you can show that you understand these details, the better your evaluation will be."

        text: "I want to solve it myself",
        score: 0.5,
        emoji: "üü°",
        explanation: "The attitude of ``I want to solve the problem myself'' is a wonderful thing because it gives you a sense of independence. However, in Japanese workplaces, dealing with problems alone can be viewed negatively. Especially in the case of foreign workers, there are many problems that they cannot solve on their own due to language and cultural differences.\n\nIf you give this answer, add in the interview, ``If you can't solve the problem, I'll talk to you.'' You can show a balanced attitude by saying, ``I'll think about it myself first, but if I don't understand, I'll talk to you right away.''\n\nIn fact, in the workplace, you need both the ability to solve problems on your own and the ability to consult appropriately. The ideal person is someone who can solve simple problems on their own and consult with others about difficult problems or problems in which they have difficulty making a decision.\n\nAlso, if the reason you want to solve the problem yourself is out of a humble feeling that you don't want to cause trouble to others, that's great. However, in Japanese workplaces, asking for advice is not a nuisance, but rather is seen as having a sense of responsibility and being able to work as a team. If you can show that you understand this, you can improve your rating."

        text: "I'm not good at consulting",
        score: 0.3,
        emoji: "üü¢",
        explanation: "The answer ``I don't like giving advice'' may be honest, but it's a big negative in interviews. In Japanese workplaces, not being able to talk to someone when you have a problem is considered a big risk. This is because if the problem is left unaddressed, it may develop into a big problem.\n\nIf you have given this answer, be sure to explain why you are not good at it and how to overcome it. If you show a positive attitude, such as, ``I'm not good at counseling because I'm not comfortable with words, but I'll prepare notes and consult with you,'' or ``I'm a shy person, but when I have a problem, I'll muster up the courage to ask for help,'' you can improve your evaluation.\n\nThere are various reasons why people don't like counseling. Feeling embarrassed, afraid of being scolded, not being able to understand the language, not knowing who to talk to, etc. These concerns are common to many foreigners. However, a good company will have an environment where it is easy to consult with them, and they will also have a support system for foreigners.\n\nYou can also practice counseling. Start with simple questions, make notes in advance, use a translation app, etc. Even if you are not good at counseling, you can overcome it with some effort. During the interview, it is important to emphasize this will to overcome."
